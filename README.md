# Hello!

Roguelike Browser Boilerplate helps you get your web based roguelike up and running fast.

The boilerplate takes care of the boring stuff so you can focus on the fun part: making the game.
It includes **level generation, rooms, scenery, item boxes, inventory, an example monster implementation, splash screen, start screen, credits screen, instructions screen, settings screen, menus, pixel styled UI, win/lose condition screens, sound effects, juicy CSS game animations**. It works on **mobile and desktop** with a custom touch-screen interface.

Roguelike Browser Boilerplate is fully open source and MIT licsensed. Yes, that means **you can use it for commercial projects**, no problem.

# Documentation
