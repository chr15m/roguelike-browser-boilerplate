Welcome to the Roguelike Browser Boilerplate! Let's get started making your roguelike.

If you're reading this you have already figured out how to unpack the zip file. Congratulations, acheivement unlocked!

The next step is to open `index.html` in your browser. You can do that however you like but the easiest thing is probably just double-clicking it.

Once you've done that you're going to want to open both `index.html` and `main.js` in your text editor so you can change the code. If you don't have an editor you can use the one at https://slingcode.net/ by uploading the zip file there.
