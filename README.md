## Setup

If you're reading this you have already figured out how to unpack the zip file. Congratulations, acheivement unlocked!

The next step is to open `index.html` in your browser. You can do that however you like but the easiest thing is probably just to double-click it.

Once you've done that you're going to want to open both `index.html` and `main.js` in your text editor so you can change the code.

If you don't have a text editor you can use the one at [slingcode.net](https://slingcode.net/), just upload the zip file there and you can start editing.

### Publishing your game

A great place to publish your game is on Itch.

> Pro tip: post frequent updates and screenshots of your progress as you make your game.
> This will increase engagement when it's time to release.

### Bonus: making an app

With a few extra steps, it is possible to distribute your game as a Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android binary.

This is generally a requirement of distributing through channels like Steam.
